                    <h3>
                        Negroni
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Ah the Negroni. Bitter, sweet, deep, rich. After my very first sip of a Negroni, I thought to myself "Why in the world did I buy a bottle of Campari? This is disgusting." Oh how foolish I was...
                        The Negroni is now one of my favorite drinks. The gin is important, but the vermouth is the really fun aspect of the cocktail. There are so many options to play with!
                        I was a big fan of Cocchi de Torino for the longest time due to it's soft rootbeer notes, but I think I'm picking Carpano Antica as my general go to.
                        It's also fun to throw in some dry vermouth to tone down the sweetness for a more bitter drink.

                    <h3>
                        Martini
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        When I say Martini, I mean a Gin Martini. I know there are some Vodka fans out there, I just have yet to get on that bus. I'm sure that I'll come around like I have with Rum and Italian bitters, but that day
                        hasn't happened yet. I have made one great Vodka Martini, but the ratios were different and I included a healthy splash of Blanc Vermouth.
                        A Martini is this deceptively simple drink made up of (usually) 2 parts gin and 1 part dry vermouth topped with your preferred garnish. However, as with most things in life, the choice is yours. At least, the illusion of choice is yours.
                        I don't actually subscribe to the notion of Free Will. Anyway. I implore you to play around the ratios, and even throw some other spirits in there. I made a delicious Tequila Martini with Blanc vermouth and a slice of lime.
                        As you'll notice, Beefeater is my preferred gin, but feel free to throw in whatever is best for you. Plymouth is a great alternative if you want something less juniper forward and with a lower ABV.
                    </p>

                        <li>1 Dash Orange Bitters</li>
                        Forget what James Bond said and stir over ice until fully diluted. Strain into a chilled Nick & Nora Glass. Express lemon twist and lay it on the side of the glass. Enter Nirvana.

                    <h3>
                        The 99% (Americano w/ Tonic)
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I was going to call this a Bitter American. I have a problem with being too on the nose or leaping into the nonsensical, and really I'm just terrible at naming things. Besides, let's be honest,
                        I'm not the first person to think of trading out Club Soda for Tonic Water. I love the Negroni, and so I thought I would love the Americano just as much. It packs a lot of the same flavor without the high ABV
                        brought by the gin. Then I tried one and thought it to be a watery dissapointment. Sure, I could scale back the club soda to just a splash, but then I'm losing the upside of a tall drink.
                        What's an imbiber to do? Add tonic, duh. This was just what the doctor ordered! You maintain so much of the bitter, in your face flavor of the Negroni, match the sweetness of the red vermouth, but you extend the drink, kick up the bitter, and add some fizz to bring back the spirit of the standard Americano.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1.5oz Campari</li>
                        <li>1.5oz Dolin Rogue Vermouth</li>
                        <li>3oz Fever Tree Indian Tonic Water</li>
                        Pour Campari and Vermouth into a highball glass and stir. Add a few ice cubes. Pour in tonic and give a quick stir. Throw in a slice of orange and take a seat in your lawn chair.
